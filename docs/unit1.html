        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The break of the layer of clouds revealed the city of London, shining in a golden color. It was like an opening of a gigantic jewelry box, with billions of twinkling pieces. The roads were gold necklaces and bright green stadiums glowed like rectangular emeralds. Sparkling diamonds of white lights were scattered all over the ground. There was the River Thames and its bridges: a slender winding darkness splitting the city, with a few gold or silver rings coiling on it. Tall skyscrapers stood tall like shiny spears pointing towards the sky, guarding the jewelry of the city…</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The plane gently moved across the sky and moved across the static golden picture down below. Was it actually static though? The roads were flowing, of slowly flowing tinier lights – the slowly flowing traffic. The roads were the blood veins of the city, transporting blood cells from one place to another then another. In every little blood cell, there were people leaving for a destination just like people in this plane. Between the veins, behind every light, there were people moving around untiringly. Somewhere there should be music, loud sports games, barking of dogs, chatting, whisper of wind and trees in the dark. But I could not see them, nor could I hear them. I was so far away. I could only see billions of lighted dots and lines, and could only hear the everlasting buzzing of the plane.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I sat in the darkness, surrounded by the buzzing, and watched the glowing picture. I could not help marveling at this city and this view created by millions of people over time and at exactly this moment. Did the people know, or have they thought of that, their city is this beautiful? And that they all add up to this view? I knew it was a busy night down there, and they might be too occupied to shift their mind from what they were doing. They might be staying in their cozy room, doing work, watching television or having dinner with family. And there was no need to let their thoughts fly above into a distant sky. It was a busy night down there, and here I sat in the darkness, watching their beautiful busy night. However stunning the view was, I knew I would not stay here forever, I still belonged to a city on the solid earth like the one below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I started to think of the sky still above the plane, the darker and colder region. The astronauts in the space station, what are they thinking now? Watching our blue planet and marveling at its beauty, or busy with their jobs or missing home? And the brave Voyager 1, if it has its own thoughts, may be excited about the unprecedented journey outside the solar system, or may be &nbsp;sad and lonely as the farthest one from its mother planet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think of the astronomy class I am taking – the way we talk about planets, stars, galaxies and beyond is so casual as if we are talking about different flora in the garden. We take their existence as granted without actually thinking about them, because it is so difficult to realize their actual existence instead of just accepting plain facts on textbooks. I close my eyes trying to imagine comets rushing by, planets wandering, distant stars glowing, spinning and screaming, red giants walking into the dusk of life, black holes indistinguishably devouring everything. I try to imagine those splendid scenes in the empty universe. But I really cannot imagine them – they are too huge. I try to imagine them but only got overwhelmed,. There is no way to see the universe in my small human brain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We only belong to some certain scales. Either looking into, thinking of something much larger or smaller feels unreal and magical. It is hard to think of the size of a city and a planet or a plant cell and a virus. It’s almost impossible to think of the size of a star system and a galaxy system, or an atom and a Planck length. There was a video in my astronomy class, which had objects drawn to scale and zoomed out slowly. It started with a person and some other human-sized objects, then the person became smaller on screen, and larger items like red wood trees and pyramids appeared. Gradually, I could not see the person, and the pyramids became too small. And then I could not see the earth and nor the sun nor the milky way. Larger objects kept on emerging, but the sizes became meaningless, as they were far beyond perception and imagination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We feel passable living in a medium-sized room, walking in streets that just fit in cars and pedestrians, or sit in the narrow airplane seat right now. We just belong to a world of this scale. However, while sitting in the narrow seat, the view outside the window gave me another perspective, on this unusual aloofness. It offered an opportunity to jump out of the normal earthly life and to see and think on a larger scale. It was for us to take a break from mundanity, to look up into the sky and think about where we are. And perhaps we should have this kind of opportunity occasionally and raise our heads up. When our mind is flying, we are no longer ourselves. We are no longer small busy ants on the ground, we fly freely, like eagles, comets. We see farther.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The plane landed and the buzzing fainted away. I blended into the busy night, following the current of traffic and finally stopped the hotel room. Outside the window I could merely see stars (to be exact, celestial objects). I did not know which one is Venus, Sirius, Polaris or what, and I did not bother to think where and how far they are. I did not plan to contemplate on them for this moment; the stars looked cold. I only wanted to rest in this little cozy room right now. But I knew the stars are there, always there. And at some time, I would think of them, and they are still there, as if they are waiting for me. My thoughts would fly above the current world for a more beautiful scene. But at this moment I was in my room, lighting up another little star in the city. &nbsp;
