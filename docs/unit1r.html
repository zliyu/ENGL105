          <p>The break of the layer of clouds revealed the city of London, shining in a golden color. It was like an opening of a gigantic jewelry box, with billions of twinkling pieces. The roads were gold necklaces and bright green stadium<span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">s</span> glowed like 
            <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">

              </span> rectangular emerald<span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">s</span>. Sparkling diamonds of white lights were scattered all over the ground. There was the River Thames and its bridges: a slender winding darkness splitting the city, <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">with</span> a few gold or silver rings coiling on it. Tall skyscrapers stood tall like shiny spears pointing towards the sky, guarding the jewelry of the city…</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>The plane gently moved across the sky and moved across the static golden picture down below. Was it actually static though? The roads were flowing, of slowly flowing tinier lights – the slowly flowing traffic. The roads were the blood veins of the city, transporting blood cells from one place to another then another. In every little blood cell, there were people leaving for a destination just like people in this plane. Between the veins, behind every light, there were people moving around untiringly. Somewhere there should be music, loud sport<span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">s</span> games, barking of dogs, chatting, whisper of wind and trees in the dark. But I could not see them, nor could I hear them. I was so far away. I could only see billions of lighted dots and lines, and could only hear the everlasting buzzing of the plane.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>I sat in the darkness, surrounded by the buzzing, and watched the glowing picture. I could not help marveling at this city and this view created by millions of people over time and at exactly this moment.<span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">&nbsp;

            </span> <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">And</span> that they all add up to this view? I knew it was a busy night down there, and they might be too occupied to<span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">&nbsp;

            </span><span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">doing work, watching television or having dinner with family</span>. And there was no need to let their thoughts fly above into a distant sky. It was a busy night down there, and here I sat in the darkness, watching their beautiful busy night. However stunning the view was, I knew I would not stay here forever, I still belonged to a city on the solid earth like the one below.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p><span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">I started to think of the sky still above the plane, the darker and colder region.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">
              <s>But what about those who are even above this plane?&nbsp;</s>
            </span>The astronauts in the space station orbiting the earth, what are they thinking now? Watching <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">

            <br>
          </p>
          <p>I think of the astronomy class I am taking – the way we talk about planets, stars, galaxies and beyond is so casual as if we are talking about different flora in the garden. <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">We take their existence as granted without actually thinking about them,&nbsp;</span>because it is so difficult to realize their actual existence instead of <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">just accepting&nbsp;</span>plain facts on textbooks. I close my eyes trying to imagine comets rushing by, planets wandering, distant stars glowing, spinning and screaming, red giants walking into the dusk of life, black holes indistinguishably devouring everything. <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">

            <br>
          </p>
          <p>We only belong to some certain scales. Either looking into, thinking of something much larger or smaller feels unreal and magical. It is hard to think of the size of a city and a planet or a plant cell and a virus. It’s <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">

It started with <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">a person and some other</span> human-sized objects, then the person became smaller on screen, and larger items like red wood trees and pyramids appeared. <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">
              <s>And then&nbsp;</s>
            </span>gradually, I could not see the person, and the pyramids became too small. And then I could not see the earth and nor the sun nor the milky way. Larger objects kept <span style="color: rgb(87, 216, 105);">on</span> emerging, but the sizes became meaningless, as they were far beyond perception and imagination.</p>

          </p>
          <p>We feel passable living in a medium-sized room, walking in streets that just fit in cars and pedestrians, or sit in the narrow airplane seat right now. We just belong to a world of this scale. However, <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">

          <p>The plane landed and the buzzing fainted away. I blended into the busy night, following the current of traffic and finally stopped at <span style="color: rgb(209, 72, 65);">
