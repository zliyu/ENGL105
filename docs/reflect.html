          <p id="a"><h4>Get Started on Writing:</h4></p>
          
          <p>I always get stuck on the central argument and the structure of the essay. It is hard to know how to arrange everything when there is nothing. Therefore, I find it very helpful to just write something first - basically anything easy to write, interesting and is somehow relevant to the topic. For example, for unit 1, I was having a different central argument before writing. But as I started to write about the scene seen from plane window and tried to remember what I saw and felt, I became more immersed in that situation. And at some point, I thought of a more interesting argument and the previous one seemed a bit hollow and forced. This was how I found out what to write for Unit 1, and this experience made me less anxious about starting to write.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="b"><h4>Central Argument:</h4></p>
          
          <p>I sometimes come up with the central argument at the very end and try to make it relevant to what I wrote, which is not a good idea. The better way to do this might be start to think about the argument after having some ideas about the what to write. After having an argument to keep in mind, the writing process will be more relevant and purposeful.</p>
          <p>One thing that I also find important is to keep the central argument simple. When brainstorming, I can have many ideas and think of many materials, and I would like to incorporate all of them into my article. However, doing this would very likely risk making the article unclear as ideas are spreading all over the place. I should be brave to take down some less important points and come up with a more simple and straight-forward argument first. This will not only make writing easier but readers can understand better.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="c"><h4>Writing Outlines:</h4></p>
          <p>Writing a clear outline is very helpful for writing an article smoothly. Not only should I think about what all the paragraphs are about, but also what they do to serve the central argument, like what “level 5” argument they should have. An outline separates the whole writing into smaller task, so that I can deal with one small thing at a time and can be more concentrated.</p>
          
          <p>It is common to have adjustment during the process of writing, but it is important to always look at the outline and make adjustments to the outline as well. Doing so will help make sure everything is connected well as well as serving a purpose in the whole article.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="d"><h4>Grammar and Word Choices</h4></p>
          
          <p>Reading the article multiple times can reduce the number of grammar mistakes and improper word choices, but sometimes it is very likely for me to let some minor mistakes to slip under my eyes. Word choice is also hard to judge. The way I try is that, when in doubt, check the word and its synonyms and their example sentences to find the best option.</p>
          
          <p>An easier alternative is to let a native speaker to read my essay.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="e"><h4>The Presence of Audiences:</h4></p>
          
          <p>In order to let audiences understand what I wrote, one of the most important things to do is to make sure that the central ideas are expressed clearly. Very often I understand what I am writing about, but others do not, because the ideas are not put into clear, explicit words or there are no obvious clues leading to the ideas. Sometimes, the logic of the essay may also be a mess because I am not following a strict outline while writing.</p>
          
          <p>Therefore, before I finalize my articles, I would them from beginning to end for several times. I would try to temporarily forget about what I am writing about, and read as a new audience. Although it is not quite possible to forget my own writing, but it still helped me to find some redundant or irrelevant content, cracks in the flow of thoughts, and where to add more lines to further clarify my ideas. I would label the places where revisions were needed, including problems like word choices and grammar, and come back to them once I finished reading the whole essay. After revising, I would read again till it seems ok.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="f"><h4>Duration of Writing:</h4></p>
          
          <p>I write very slow and it often takes longer than I expected. It is usually because I do not have a clear outline of the article so that I get stuck in the middle of writing. Therefore, I think it should help that, before actually start writing a lot of content first, I should think about the outline carefully. It will also help if I start writing earlier so that I will not overestimate my speed and stay up until the last day.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="g"><h4>What I Learnt/ Improved</h4></p>
          
          <p>1. The “Uneven U” structure. This is not the best structure for every paragraph or every essay, but I find it useful, as using an “uneven U” structure can hardly go wrong and makes the essay clearer to readers.</p>
          
          <p>2. Researching about topic. I become familiar using the online database to search for scholarly materials related to my topic and narrow down search results.</p>
          
          <p>3. Writing a pitch; writing an abstract.</p>
          
          <p>4. I also learnt from reading assignments. They expose me to some topics that I was not quite aware previously.</p>
          
          <p>5. Before this semester, I had written very few English essays that is over 1000 words, and I feel a bit overwhelmed when managing a long essay. After writing these 3 essays, I am feeling a bit better, as I find some interesting topic to write about and I am more patient in reading my own essays.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="h"><h4>Why Using a Website for Portfolio?</h4></p>
          <p>Websites allow a lot of flexibility in presenting text and media – for example, the YouTube video, hyperlinks in Unit 2. The navbar also allows readers to navigate through different content easily, which is different from books/magazine. If using the form of a (electronic) book, it would be hard to find one exact page or have to scroll back a lot to go from unit 3 to unit 1. Using websites can have multiple short webpages and can jump to the desired content with one click. Plus, I use a website because I want to practice HTML/CSS, which is very useful.</p>
