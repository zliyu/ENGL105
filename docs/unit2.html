                <p>Meet the parrot superstar Sirocco, who got famous for doing crazy things on BBC. This partying parrot is funny and cute, but you may be sad to know that once his species, the kākāpōs, were on the edge of disappearing forever and are still critically endangered to this day.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Kākāpō: the owl parrot, the night parrot, the only flightless and the only nocturnal parrot, the heaviest of all parrots, one of the longest-living birds, and one of the strangest of all living-beings.[1] They are native to New Zealand and in the good old days, as there were few predators, kakapos chose to walk instead of flying, which saved lots of energy, and their wings were only used to assist their movements like balancing and elegant landings from tree branches. They also developed the habit of freezing when encountered danger –at that time, their predators hunted by sight and kakapo’s yellow-green-black feathers hid them well in the forest bushes. Kakapos used to be the third common birds in New Zealand – just imagine walking outdoors and being able to see kakapos happily hopping and climbing around! At that time, kakapos did not realize that their unique habits would make them especially vulnerable in face of ground predators hunting by smell, which would nearly wipe them off earth. They also breed irregularly, with breeding season occurs every 2-7 years when the rimu fruit ripen, and produce few offspring every time, making it harder for the population to recover. Once there were only about 50 individuals left in the world, but with huge efforts over decades, in September 2019 the kakapo population broke 200 with currently 211 individuals (as of Oct.8)[2][3] after the successful 18/19 breeding season, providing a slight sense of optimism. Let us start from the beginning, to view kakapos’ stories so far and to be continued.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Similar to almost all stories of endangered/extinct species – humans are again the cause of kakapo’s downfall. Māori were the first, who hunted and ate kakapos and brought predators like kiore (Pacific rat) and kurī (Polynesian dog). They also killed kakapos for the colorful and soft feathers for decoration. Kakapos’ territory on the islands kept shrinking and much more rapid decline of the population began after European settlement in the 1800s, when cats, stoats, and more rats were brought to the island. New-commers like deer and possums were competing against kakapos for food and large-scale exploitation also resulted severe habitat loss. This kind of weird parrots, who do not seem to fit the modern world, was faced with very serious problems. They were at this situation not because of natural processes, but because of the ignorance of humans. Now we know the importance of preserving species for reasons such as biodiversity, but people at that time did not. Even though, they were aware of the decline in the number of kakapos, but not really anyone cared or tried to stop hurting innocent kakapos and make up the mistakes committed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first governmental attempt to save the kakapos was not made until 1894 when conservationist Richard Henry was appointed to rescue the endangered species. He led the effort to transfer nearly four hundred of kakapos to the predator-free islands in Fiordland. Unfortunately, stoats swam to those islands within years, and almost wiped out all the kakapos in Fiordland. The countdown of the species had truly begun. Although Henry’s effort failed, his method of translocation – moving kakapos to more suitable locations – is critical for conservation in the future. What he did also inspires people in the future to make efforts to protect these lovely birds.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Kakapos became terribly scarce but no further real effort was made until the Wildlife Service was found around 1950s. Till around 1970s, over 60 expeditions were made in searching for kakapos, only a few dozens of birds were found. Some were captured but most died within a month. The biggest problem was that among all kakapos that were discovered, no females were found. The kakapos seemed to be functionally extinct, which means despite that there are still individuals left, the species could not continue without any female. Was this truly the end of the kakapos? Did we actually fail at covering our past mistakes?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Perhaps as a reward of years of hard work, there finally came the turning point: in 1977, more than 200 kakapos are located in southern Stewart Island and females are identified in 1980. This population then became the subject of huge amounts of research, and the cornerstone of future management. But as the feral cats on Stewart Island were found to kill kakapos at a high rate, all birds were transported to other 3 islands with few predators. Although the translocation increased their survival rate, more birds died than were born, a more effective plan was needed[7]. Along with the foundation of the Department of Conservation in 1987 in replacement of the Wildlife Service, the National Kākāpō Team and a ten-year Kākāpō Recovery Plan[4], the intensive management of kakapos had truly begun – from when kakapos started to make a slow comeback.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The translocation of the birds proved to be successful in lowering kakapo death resulted from predation, and it is also used for other purposes. Some kakapos are relocated to test whether a new habitat is suitable for their living. Some other times, birds are relocated because of ongoing eradication of predators on their original island and they are transferred so that they will not be hurt accidentally.[7]</p>
                <br>
                <p>Besides, on islands that are not entirely predator-free, it was also important to protect the nests of kakapo during hatching, as rat predation was once the most prominent cause of chick death. Numerous traps and poison stations were placed to kill rats, and nests were closely watched from cameras. Besides, some careless kakapo moms may build their nests improperly, such as building nests in places that can be exposed to heavy rains. Scientists then will modify their nests so eggs and chicks can have a more safe and comfy home. Nests may also be modified in order to install cameras to better monitor them.[7]</p>
                <br>
                <p>It is also very intuitive to consider artificial incubation – hatching eggs in a man-made environment – and hand raising chicks as a way to reduce death rates of young kakapos. In 1990/91 breeding season, people tried to hatch eggs artificially, but it turned out to be not successful. Since then, artificial incubation and hand raising has gradually became a last resort. For example, this method is used when there are sick or starving chicks, when there are predators around that may harm kakapos, or when the eggs or chicks in a specific nest are predicted to be vulnerable. However, something interesting was found in the 98/99 breeding season: 2 female kakapos, after whose eggs were removed for artificial incubation, laid more eggs. This was the first time that kakapos were known to be able to lay eggs more than once during a single breeding season. Scientists since started to try to remove eggs in order to make females lay more eggs – and this became one of the reasons of the great success in the 18/19 breeding season.[7]</p>
                <br>
                <p>Giving supplementary food to kakapos does not seem to hurt. Scientists also thought so – they found that providing food to females during breeding season, especially when the rimu fruits do not ripen, helps increase the survival rate of their eggs. However, the exact mechanism of how supplementary feeding were not clear.[7] Problems revealed later: the offspring of fed females have an imbalanced sex ratio, where there were more males than females. This was not a good thing because more females are needed for an increase in the population. It is then concluded that the supplementary food should be enough to help their breeding and not too much so that it will result in more male offspring.[8] Supplementary feeding had not been very successful, but a 2015 study revealed the importance of calcium and vitamin D for the development of chicks, suggesting a better food composition for feeding kakapos.[9]</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are so many efforts that led to an increase in population of 70% in the past 3.5 years and the success of the 18/19 breeding season, but so many challenges lie ahead. First, the population will decline until next breeding season, as old birds may die and weak young birds cannot survive. Next, as there are more and more kakapos, the small islands currently hold them are not enough for more. Scientists need to find more habitat for them, which might involve more habitat researching and testing, and predator elimination.[2] Currently, the most urgent problem is the spreading of aspergillosis, an infectious fungus disease that has caused several birds to die. A huge number of researches are now underway to fight this disease.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why is it important to save the kakapos? Why do we need to spend this much efforts just to have some more weird parrots? On the science side, one answer is biodiversity – our ecosystem is only strong when there is a lot of diversity. But besides science, our intuition also tells us that it is simply wrong to let an innocent, helpless species to die out because of our faults. Looking at the history, we have done so much harm to the kakapos. We cannot do nothing about it, and what people are doing right now is just trying to make up a tiny bit to the kakapos’ great loss. We should stop to be too selfish, and simply learn to care about others.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although the science of saving kakapos might sound intimidating, there are ways for us common people to get involved in helping these lovely parrots. You can visit the official website of

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because of ignorance and indifference, humans caused many species to go extinct or nearly extinct within hundreds of years, while the nature needs around 50 million years to recover from the effects[10]. Now tremendous amounts of money, labor and resources have to be spent for decades, if not centuries, in order to bring hope to kakapos and other endangered animals. It is only thanks to numerous efforts made by countless dedicated people over many decades, that kakapos are having the chance to make a comeback, and we are lucky to witness their dramatic stories to be continued. All of us can be a positive part – even a very small part – of their journey, and we need to start now.</p>
