              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">— Abstract —</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">When you arrive at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or even before that, one of the first thing you will learn is to hate Duke. The Carolina-Duke rivalry is not just the greatest rivalry on NCAA basketball field, but also something that has deep impact on both campuses. By reading past news articles and blogs, as well as conversations with several current students, I hope to explore how the rivalry exist on UNC campus and how students perceive, feel or react about it. While the rivalry surely brings students in one school together, it might also induce prejudice, or improper speech and actions against people in another school. In my opinion, the rivalry is a special part of our college experience, and we should enjoy the rivalry and “hate” Duke in a proper way.</span></p>

              <p>I never had the motivation of watching American football until that weekend when we, University of North Carolina, played against Duke University. I sat in the lounge of my dorm with a dozen of other students. Although I could hardly understand the game, I stared at the television as hard as everyone else. When we went into the fourth quarter 17–17, I even started to feel nervous. As the Tar Heels finally sealed the victory with a beautiful interception seconds before the end of match, the small lounge burst out huge cheers and applause, and laughter when the Duke coach appeared in screen with a dead face. When I was walking out of the dorm, my friend who claimed to have no interest in football walked to me with big smile on her face – “We won!” she said excitedly. Outside in the warm night there was a mist of happiness cast on the campus. People wearing Carolina blue were everywhere. The bell tower was lit a lovely blue color, as it slowly rang the tune “…Hail to the brightest Star of all. Clear its radiance shine…”.</p>
              <div style="align-self: center;"><center>
                  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Bell 🔔 is Back!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarolinaFootball?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CarolinaFootball</a> 🏈 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeTheOne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BeTheOne</a> <a href="https://t.co/bh5prEELa3">pic.twitter.com/bh5prEELa3</a></p>&mdash; Carolina Football (@TarHeelFootball) <a href="https://twitter.com/TarHeelFootball/status/1188234191676346368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

              <p>As a freshman, I have not yet experienced the crazier basketball games. But I can already feel the huge excitement and joy as I read about the scene of rushing Franklin Street after beating Duke. “Can you smell it? That sweet, sweet mixture. The sweat of thousands of people who just sprinted from every direction. The smoke of a freshly lit bonfire burning on Franklin Street. The putrid scent of misery and despair drifting down 15–501 from 10 miles away” writes an article in Daily Tar Heel (Goins, 2019). Imagine that, thousands of people all come together to celebrate one same thing. No matter how different we are from each other, if you are a Tar Heel, then Duke is your enemy and you are one of us — and now it is time for us to celebrate together.</p>
              <br>
              <p>What is so special to bring UNC students together is the long-lasting rivalry between University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. College rivalry usually forms when schools are located close to each other and/or are competitive in some common fields. Located only about 10 miles apart and both doing well in sports and academics, UNC and Duke have the perfect condition to become rivals and maintain this rivalry. The UNC-Duke rivalry started with two notable families in North Carolina, the Mangums and the Dukes. When a secret — unwed Chaney Mangum and married Taylor Duke had given birth to a child — was revealed, the relationship of these two families had since then gone bad. And these two families continued to fight for power and dominance in North Carolina. The Mangums were supporters of UNC, while the Dukes used the money from their tobacco industry to support Trinity College, which was later renamed Duke. Slowly, the rivalry between two families transformed into the rivalry between two schools (Frederick, 2019). The modern-day rivalry, on the other hand, exists most prominently in the context of basketball games. However, the rivalry definitely does not limit to basketball, as it can be observed in many aspects of campus life.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The rivalry can be seen in every sport when they play against each other. John Beeson, captain of the club hockey team said “Whether they’re bad or good, it doesn’t really matter. We want to beat the pants off them. Like, it’s Duke. No matter what we want to beat them 10–0.” Jackson Ozello, a captain on the men’s club lacrosse team, also agrees that there is an increased focus when facing Duke (Forrest, 2019).</p>
              <br>
              <p>Moreover, the rivalry can be brought up in a different context other than sports. In my computer science class, the professor used a rivalry match as an example to illustrate Java design pattern. My astronomy professor would joke about how he threw away a Duke umbrella belong to his colleague. And across campus, people where shirts writing “BEAT DUKE” are never hard to find.</p>
              <br>
              <p>They all say that one of the first things you learn at UNC is to “hate” Duke. In my case, I quickly learnt to call the school “dook” as soon as I arrived here and have found dook to be more unlikable as time goes. But do UNC students really hate Duke? A survey in 2010 showed that only about 17% of UNC student said that they would use the word “hate” when talking about their rival. (“Do duke, UNC fans hate each other? not so much,” 2010)</p>
              <br>
              <p>“I do not really hate Duke,” a student from China says, “but I might hate it when I am in a group of UNC students.” Another student has even more positive view towards Duke: “I don’t really care a lot about the rivalry. To be honest, I kind of like Duke honestly. They have great academics… and their campus is so beautiful!” However, she then added “but I think many students there are arrogant — they are either super smart or super rich. People here are much nicer!” My roommate, who is from Raleigh, says “I think the rivalry most exist in sports, but my mom (who graduated from UNC) hates Duke in nearly every aspect. Anyways, Duke is a very expensive school, and its students are rich. I mean, I’m not referring to all of them — but some of them are so pretentious and annoying.”</p>
              <br>
              <p>While some students have quite moderate attitude towards Duke, there are some that go on to the far side of the spectrum. In 1990, student Ian Williams wrote the famous Daily Tar Heel column: Why I Hate Duke. For him, the hatred started from his campus tour to Duke where he met hostile Duke students, and the hatred stayed and grew. He wrote, “I hate every leaf of every tree on that sickening campus. I hate every fake cherub Gothic piece of crap that litters the buildings like hemorrhoidal testaments to imagined superiority. When I see those Dookie boneheads shoe-polishing their faces navy blue on television, squandering their parents’ money with their fratty elitist bad sportsmanship antics and Saab stories, I want to puke all over Durham.” (Lawson &amp; Williams, 2010)</p>
              <br>
              <p>Whether hate Duke a lot or not, rich, proud and overall annoying might be the words many UNC students would think of when describing Duke people. However, this is not true for everyone in Duke. It is correct that Duke students are generally richer, given Duke’s average annual cost is much higher than UNC ($35735 and $14163 for in-state students), but many Duke students are receiving financial aid from school. In fact, 47% of Duke undergraduates are receiving some kind of financial aid (US News World Report, n.d.). Moreover, it is clearly not correct to say every Duke student is annoying. For example, I know three people from my high school who went to Duke and they are not especially proud or annoying. I do not imagine them suddenly becomes evil once they enter Duke. If I say every Duke person is disgusting, I feel bad to include them as well. Truly there are a bunch of annoying people from Duke, but like my roommate says “…not referring to all of them…”.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In my opinion, despite that “hate” is a very negative word, I do not think it is possible to conclude whether it is proper to hate Duke (or for Duke students to hate UNC), given that everyone defines the word differently. But there are definitely some lines between what is proper or not. If UNC fans and Duke fans start a fight because of a basketball match, it is clearly not proper. Another simple example is seen in a comment section of Daily Tar Heel: a Duke graduate student who was a UNC undergrad wrote that, his/her car got vandalized by Duke students just because the car has Carolina logo on it. Obviously, here the Duke students have crossed the line. And when you hear that US Rep. Brad Miller said “I have said very publicly that if Duke was playing against the Taliban, then I’d have to pull for the Taliban.”(Litke, 2012), you know that the line was crossed by a lot, although it was a joke.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The UNC-Duke rivalry is something special, as it magically unifies students within one school. It infiltrates into many aspects of campus life even outside the region of sports, and definitely adds more fun and more topics for students and fans. However, we should also be aware some negative impact it may induce: prejudice and even discrimination are some examples.</p>
              <br>
              <p>As the rivalry divides UNC and Duke into two different sides, it creates an ingroup (“us”) and an outgroup (“them”) — in this case, UNC and Duke respectively. Social psychology theories (Brown &amp; Hewstone, 2005; Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2016) suggest that people tend to like and agree with people within one’s own group (in-group bias). Some psychologists believe that people inevitably magnify their difference from outgroup members. Combined with in-group bias, this idea indicates that people cannot avoid having stereotypes — ideas of what members of another group are like. Stereotypes can be positive or negative, true or false. However, with a general lack of familiarity with outgroup, people are likely to think of outgroup members as similar (out-group homogeneity). Unfortunately, this might subsequently cause prejudice, as someone uncritically apply negative stereotypes to all members of a group, or even discrimination when one acts upon prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
              <br>
              <p>Whether you hate Duke or not, or how much you hate it, prejudice and discrimination should be avoided. We all know that we should not judge people based on their nationalities, racial identities, gender… – based on the group they are in. And this is similar here (although those students choose to attend Duke). Even if you hate Duke a lot, you should still treat every person with respect first. Blindly labeling everyone at Duke as awful will only hurt nice and innocent people there. After all, there are good and bad people at UNC and at all other schools, and Duke is no exception. College is a place for one to meet different people and accept diversity – to get to know “out-group members”, and putting down one’s prejudice against all Duke people can also be part of the experience. According to contact theory (Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2007; Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2016), getting to interact with another out-group member will help reduce prejudice. There are quite some opportunities that UNC students can collaborate with Duke students, and these shall hopefully decrease the hostility against Duke. (Unfortunately for me, I got to collaborate with 2 Duke students at a hackathon – and it was not a good experience. Still I know not everyone is like them!)</p>
              <br>
              <p>In my opinion, the rivalry means to compete, thus requires us to be better — but it is not limited to being better at a particular sport. It is also an opportunity to have better connection with fellow UNC students. Perhaps, you can make more friends at games or when rushing Franklin, or laugh with your friends some funny jokes and memes about Duke. Besides, the rivalry should not be something to hinder you from being a better person as well. I do not think it is improper to hate Duke as a school if you have good reason. Nonetheless, to prejudice, to hurt individuals just because of the rivalry are not just in themselves wrong, it also makes yourself look bad as well. Meanwhile, it would be better to be open-minded to accept actual nice people from Duke, and do not let the rivalry prevents potential friendships and collaborations. And this not only applies to UNC and Duke students and fans, it can also apply to fans of other colleges, or of different sports clubs as well. In a simple conclusion: enjoy the rivalry!</p>
